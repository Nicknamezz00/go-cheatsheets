## Circuit Breaker

Similar to electrical fuses that prevent fires when a circuit that is connected to the electrical grid starts drawing a high amount of power which causes the wires to heat up and combust, the circuit breaker design pattern is a fail-first mechanism that shuts down the circuit, request/response relationship or a service in the case of software development, to prevent bigger failures.
